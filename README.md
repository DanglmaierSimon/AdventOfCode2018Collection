# Advent Of Code 2018 Collection

Collection of Code from the Advent Of Code 2018

This is not supposed to be a collection of the best (not even of good) solutions. It's mostly aimed at beginners and readability. Additionally I also use this as a chance to learn Go, so the code might not be the best use of the language.
